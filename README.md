# Effective and Performant App

## Overview

This project is a refactored Angular application designed to be an **effective, performant, and app nice to work with**. It consumes data from the TVMaze API to display a list of shows and related information. The refactor addresses code quality, maintainability, UI responsiveness, and scalability, following best practices in modern Angular development.

## Main Improvements

### 1. **Code Quality and Readability**
- **Consistent code style:** Adopted Angular and TypeScript style guides for naming, formatting, and structure improving readability.
- **Clean folder structure:** Organized codebase for scalability and clarity.
- **Use of TypeScript interfaces:** Defined clear interfaces `(ShowResponse, CastResponse and ShowDTO)` to ensure type safety and better documentation. These interfaces provide strong contracts between layers and make it easy to transform and validate data structures across the application.
- **Unit tests:** Coverage for adapters to ensure correctness.

### 2. **Architecture & Patterns**
- **Adapter pattern:** Implemented adapters (e.g., `mapShowResponseToDTO`) to decouple API data structures from UI models, facilitating future changes and improving testability.
- **Smart/dumb components pattern**: Split large components into smaller, focused ones, applying the smart and dumb (container/presentational) components pattern. This ensures that data logic and UI rendering are clearly separated, reducing complexity and improving testability and reusability.
- **Facade pattern  and encapsulation:** Centralized business logic and state in facades, exposing only necessary data to components via getters. This keeps components clean and decoupled from implementation details.
- **Reactive programming:** Leveraged RxJS for live search and efficient data flows, ensuring responsive UI and optimal resource management.

### 3. **UI Performance**
- **Optimized image handling:** Managed image sizes implementing lazy loading with `NgOptimizedImage` and provided default `.webp` placeholder for missing images, ensuring consistent and smooth card layouts while improving performance.
- **Responsive design:** Applied grid layouts and Angular Material components for a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing interface.
- **Use of CSS color variables:** Centralized all color variables in a dedicated stylesheet, ensuring consistent color usage and making it easy to update or theme the application's palette across all components.
- **Infinite scroll and caching:** Implemented infinite scrolling and an improved caching strategy to provide faster, uninterrupted data loading.

## Potential Future Improvements
- **UI improvements:** Enhanced caching and search systems, and streamlined the UI by merging related components.
- **Error boundaries:** Implement global error handling for improved UX, and control empty results.
- **Fix outstanding bugs:** Address minor issues that could not be resolved due to limited time.
- **Testing:** Add more tests to cover the whole app.
- **Accessibility enhancements:** Follow the standards of accessibility.
- **Add tools:** Add tools like ESLint, Danger.js, and Conventional Commits to enforce code quality and team consistency.
- **State management:** Integrate NgRx or another state library for complex state scenarios.
- **Update Angular version:** Keep Angular up to date to benefit from the latest features and fixes.
- **Pre-push checks:** Automate tests, linting, and commit conventions to ensure code quality before merging.

## How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**  
   `npm install`
2. **Run the app:**  
   `npm start` or `ng serve`

## Conclusion

This refactor transforms the original codebase into a **robust, maintainable, and performant Angular application**. The applied patterns and improvements not only solve immediate issues but also lay a solid foundation for future growth and features.
While the core architecture and optimizations are in place, the application is not yet fully complete. The structure, patterns, and optimizations implemented ensure that the project can be easily extended and finalized, following best practices. Several planned improvements and features remain to be developed, as outlined above, to fully realize the app’s potential.
